# AWS ELB Diagram Generator

This is a simple script that generates a diagram of an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and its associated instances. The script uses the `boto3` library to query the AWS API for information about the ELB and its instances. The diagram is generated using the `diagram` library.

Here is the screenshot of the diagram generated by the script:
